My name is Amirhosein Javadi, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California San Diego(UCSD). Prior to joining UCSD, I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology (SUT) in 2023. I am generally curious about the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Optimization.
