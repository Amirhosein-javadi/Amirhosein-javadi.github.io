I'm a bachelor student studying Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology. I was incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to work with [Professor Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/) about nash equilibrium in CycleGAN.

Research Interest
======
I am generally curious about the intersection of Machine Learning, Privacy, High Dimensional Statistics and Optimization. 

I have worked on:
- Compute Nahs in CycleGAN
- Liver Tumor Segmentation over LITS17
- Depth Estimation in Surgery Rooms
- Reinforcement Learning for Break-down game
- Panorama and Video Processing
- SEFDM Communication
