My name is Amirhosein Javadi, and I am a Ph.D. student in ECE at UCSD, advised by Professor [Tara Javidi](https://tjavidi.eng.ucsd.edu). Prior to joining UCSD, I received a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Professor Mohammad Hossein Yassaee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y6vuiBUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Professor Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&hl=en). I am generally curious about the intersection of Machine Learning, GenerativeAI, and Active Learning.
