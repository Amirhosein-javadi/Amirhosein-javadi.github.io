## Breakout game with Reinforcement Learning
In this project, I learned how to implement a Deep-Q-Network (DQN), and to demonstrate that, I implemented and trained a DQN and run it on an Atari game in OpenAI-Gym environment.

In this game you control a space ship that shoots bullets. At each frame, you may either move up, down, or stay still. Every once in a while some meteors colored in red show up at random at the other end of the screen and you should avoid or destroy them. If either one of these meteors hits you, you will die!

To destroy the meteors, you have to shoot them three times and each time you shoot them their color changes until they disappear. They change color from red to orange to yellow and then they are gone.
