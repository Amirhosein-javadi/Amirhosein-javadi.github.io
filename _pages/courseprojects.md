## **Breakout game with Reinforcement Learning ([Link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Artificial-Intelligence-Homeworks/tree/main/HW5/Breakout_RL))**

In this project, I learned how to implement a Deep-Q-Network (DQN), and to demonstrate that, I implemented and trained a DQN and run it on an Atari game in OpenAI-Gym environment.

In this game you control a space ship that shoots bullets. At each frame, you may either move up, down, or stay still. Every once in a while some meteors colored in red show up at random at the other end of the screen and you should avoid or destroy them. If either one of these meteors hits you, you will die!

To destroy the meteors, you have to shoot them three times and each time you shoot them their color changes until they disappear. They change color from red to orange to yellow and then they are gone.

## **Face Detection Using HOG ([Link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Face-Detection-Using-HOG-Computer-Vision))**
The histogram of oriented gradients **(HOG)** is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.

In this project, I implement a Face Detection model with HOG descriptor and run this model some images.

## **Panorama and Video Processing ([Link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Panorama-and-Video-Processing-Computer-Vision))**
In this project, I learned to create a panorama from 5 keyframes in a video. This video ([Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uBBLlRxK5YRrL7Tn56Gqt-QkAZrCMWrB/view)) is taken from a boulevard full of moving cars and pedestrians while the cameraman is rotating horizontally.

In addition to this, I extracted the background and forground of each frame of this video.

## **Perspective Transformation with Homography ([Link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Computer-Vision-Homework/tree/main/HW1/RANSAC%20and%20Sift))**
In this project, I implemented the perspective transform with homography with RANSAC and Sift. I apply my algorithm to a pair of photo.

I also implemeted this algorithm from scratch, which is available in [this link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Computer-Vision-Homework/tree/main/HW1/Homography-Implementing-from-scratch). 

## **Poisson Blending ([Link](https://github.com/Amirhosein-javadi/Image-Processing-Homework/tree/main/HW5/Poisson%20Blending))**
In this project, I implemented the poisson blending algorithm from scratch. I apply my algorithm to a pair of photo.
