My name is Amirhosein Javadi, and I am a first-year Ph.D candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego(UCSD). Prior to joining UCSD, I received the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology (SUT) in 2023. I am generally curious about the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Optimization.
