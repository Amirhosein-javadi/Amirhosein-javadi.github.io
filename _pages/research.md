## **Nash in CycleGAN**
In a paper named [GANs May Have No Nash Equilibria](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09124.pdf), it is shown that WGAN-WC, WGAN-GP, and SNGAN may have no nash equilibrium. It means that after training the Generator and Discriminator for some iterations, the pair $(G_{Î¸_{final}}, D_{w_{final}})$ does not represent a Nash equilibrium. It means that by fixing the trained discriminator and optimizing the generator, the generator will change. In my research project, I showed that Nash equilibrium is viable in the [CycleGAN ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) paradigm theoretically and by simulations.
